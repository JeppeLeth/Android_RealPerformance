    <string name="statement1_header">Feels like Home</string>
    <string name="statement1_desc">Realmâ€™s data structures look like the Objects and Arrays of your language, but provide additional features such as: querying, relationships &amp; graphs, thread safety, and more.\nCompared to Core Data or other ORMs, you get a much simpler API, easy thread-safety and much improved performance on reads &amp; writes.</string>
    <string name="statement2_header">Memory-Efficient</string>
    <string name="statement2_desc">Realm is not built on SQLite. Instead, a custom C++ core is used to provide memory-efficient access to your data by using Realm objects, which usually consume less RAM than native objects. The core also provides an optional persistence layer that can automatically save and retrieve your objects from disk.</string>
    <string name="statement3_header">F-F-Fast!</string>
    <string name="statement3_desc">Realm offers extraordinary performance compared to SQLite and other persistence solutions.\nIt has been in development since 2011 and powers an app with over 1 million daily active users at Zynga.</string>
